# Project Todo

## Pending (do on main branch)

- [ ] **Upgrade vitest to v4** — Resolves vite version conflict (vitest 2.1.9 requires vite@5, but project uses vite@7). This causes `pnpm check` TypeScript errors. Run: `pnpm update vitest @vitest/coverage-v8 @vitest/ui`

## Completed

- [x] Integrate Carta markdown editor (editor branch)
